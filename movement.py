# Challenge Task 1 of 1
# Our game's player only has two attributes, x and y coordinates. Let's practice with a slightly different one, though. This one has x, y, and "hp", which stands for hit points.

# Our move function takes this three-part tuple player and a direction tuple that's two parts, the x to move and the y(like(-1, 0) would move to the left but not up or down).

# Finish the function so that if the player is being run into a wall, their hp is reduced by 5. Don't let them go past the wall. Consider the grid to be 0-9 in both directions. Don't worry about keeping their hp above 0 either.


# EXAMPLES:
# move((1, 1, 10), (-1, 0)) => (0, 1, 10)
# move((0, 1, 10), (-1, 0)) => (0, 1, 5)
# move((0, 9, 5), (0, 1)) => (0, 9, 0)

def move(player, direction):
    x, y, hp = player
    xx, yy = direction  # corrected that "XX" error
    if xx == -1 and x == 0:
        hp -= 5
    elif xx == 1 and x == 9:
        hp -= 5
    elif yy == -1 and y == 0:
        hp -= 5
    elif yy == 1 and y == 9:
        hp -= 5
    else:
        x += xx
        y += yy
    return x, y, hp
