# Challenge Task 1 of 1
# I haven't shown you how to use this function yet but I'm sure you can use it. In the random library, there's a function named sample that takes two arguments: an iterable to sample from, and an integer of how many unique samples to return.

# Finish the get_locations function so that it returns 3 unique values from the cells argument.

import random

def get_locations(cells):
    #pass
    return random.sample(cells, 3)
